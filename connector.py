"""PostgreSQL connector package for Analitiq.

``PostgresConnector`` is the class resolved via the ``postgres`` entry
points (``analitiq.source_connectors`` /
``analitiq.destination_connectors``); ``PostgresDialect`` is attached
through its ``dialect_class``, not entry-point-resolved.

Transports: ADBC (libpq, COPY-based Arrow ingestion - the default) and
async SQLAlchemy (asyncpg - the engine-side SQL/metadata path). The
write-direction type vocabulary lives entirely in
the ``write`` section of ``definition/type-map.json``; this module ships no Python
type-rendering table and carries only the structural dialect hooks the
two transports require.

The write path is the CDK's uniform stage-then-apply cycle, expressed
through the sanctioned ``SqlDialect`` hooks: ``stage_table_sql`` renders
the stage DDL and ``merge_statement_sql`` renders the upsert. Emptying
(``empty_table_sql``) and native landing (``bulk_land``) are deliberately
left on the base - the ANSI ``DELETE FROM`` is already correct for
PostgreSQL, and ``bulk_load.adbc: adbc_ingest`` is the ADBC backend's own
landing rather than a dialect-implemented mechanism.

        asyncpg takes TLS through a single connect parameter, so the
        singular hook is the right one (the CDK lands the return value
        under ``connect_args["ssl"]``). This hook serves the ``sqlalchemy``
        transport only; the ADBC transport does not come through here and
        carries no TLS options of its own. The libpq ADBC driver rejects
        every ``adbc.postgresql.*`` database option with ``NOT_IMPLEMENTED``
        before any network I/O, and libpq's ``sslrootcert`` expects a
        filesystem path a stored PEM secret cannot supply, so under ADBC
        ``verify-ca`` / ``verify-full`` fall back to libpq's default CA
        lookup. CA pinning requires the ``sqlalchemy`` transport.

        Mode handling:

        * ``verify-ca`` / ``verify-full`` require a CA bundle and build an
          ``SSLContext`` pinned to it; hostname checking is enabled only
          for ``verify-full``.
        * ``require`` **with** a CA bundle also verifies, mirroring
          libpq's documented semantics: "only try an SSL connection. If a
          root CA file is present, verify the certificate in the same way
          as if verify-ca was specified." Without a bundle it passes
          through as an encryption-only requirement.
        * ``disable`` / ``allow`` / ``prefer`` pass through as libpq mode
          strings.

        Anything else raises: the engine performs no vocabulary
        validation before the dialect sees the value (the connector.json
        enum is control-plane only), so an unrecognized or case-variant
        mode must fail here rather than silently bypass the
        CA-verification path.

        PostgreSQL clones a table's shape with ``(LIKE target INCLUDING

        not copied: a stage needs neither, and copying a UNIQUE constraint
        would make the landing INSERT reject rows the merge is supposed to
        resolve.

        The connector declares ``stage.scope: real`` and ``stage.schema:
        target``, so ``temp`` arrives ``False`` and the stage is an
        ordinary relation in the target's own schema - the ``temp`` branch
        is kept genuinely conditional rather than hard-coded, so the
        rendered DDL always matches the declared scope. PostgreSQL DDL is
        transactional (``transactional_ddl: true``), so the create and the

        leaves nothing behind.

        is portable to every supported server; SQL-standard ``MERGE`` only
        exists from PostgreSQL 15 and is deliberately not used.

        The source is the stage table, referenced once, so no batch value
        is ever rendered into SQL text - values reach the stage as bound
        parameters or through the ADBC ingest path. Updated columns are the
        landed columns minus the conflict keys: a target column the batch
        did not land (a physical column added out-of-band, the
        engine-managed ``_synced_at``) keeps its stored value on a matched
        row and takes its DEFAULT on an inserted one.

        When every landed column is a conflict key there is nothing to
        update, and ``DO UPDATE SET`` with an empty list is a syntax error,
        so the contract's insert-only degradation renders ``DO NOTHING``.

        Known precondition, inherited from the grammar: PostgreSQL resolves
        an ON CONFLICT target only against a real UNIQUE / PRIMARY KEY
        constraint or index, so an upsert into a target without one fails
        loudly rather than silently appending duplicates.
